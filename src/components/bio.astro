    I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.ic.gatech.edu/"
      >School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech</a
    >, where I am gratefully advised by <a
      href="https://dellaert.github.io/"
      target="_blank">Prof. Frank Dellaert</a
    >.

    <br /><br />
    My areas of research are Robotics, Perception, and Autonomy. I am particularly
    interested in mobile robot autonomy and the mathematical tools and techniques
    to enable this.

    <br /><br />
    Currently, I am focused on proprioceptive state estimation of legged robots using
    concepts from machine learning and nonlinear control. Robot dynamics are intuitive
    constraints since they obey nature's laws, thus being able to model the observable
    and the latent processes underlying legged locomotion, we can extract useful information
    about the robot's state without the need for exterioceptive sensors such as cameras.

    <br /><br />
    I am also a maintainer of <a
      href="https://github.com/borglab/gtsam"
      target="_blank">GTSAM</a
    >, an industrial-strength factor graph library for robotics, as well as its
    sister projects (e.g. <a
      href="https://github.com/borglab/gtdynamics/"
      target="_blank">GTDynamics</a
    >).
