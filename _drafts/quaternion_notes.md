# Notes and Resources for Understanding Quaternions

- Great slideshow introducing rotations, euler angles and quaternions [here](http://run.usc.edu/cs520-s12/quaternions/quaternions-cs520.pdf).

- Comprehensive resource for all the math: [link](http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/)


- Neat article about Quaternions and Octonions can be found [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-octonion-math-that-could-underpin-physics-20180720/).
