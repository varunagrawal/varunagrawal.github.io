## Resistance Training

Resistance or Strength training involves using weights to build strength, shock your CNS into increasing your metabolism, and activating your muscles into growing bigger and more defined to get rid of the skinny-fat look. Resistance training in the gym usually gets a bad rep due to the idea of bro culture that is prevalent, that gym goers are not intelligent human beings. In my personal experience, consistent resistance training has had the greatest effect on my overall fitness, not just in aesthetics but feeling good and strong throughut the day without the tiredness that comes from cardio training. Don't knock it till you give it a try.

Here, I try to avoid broscience (training misconceptions spread by the less informed) and focus on proven techniques involving compound exercises that hit multiple muscle groups (in contrast to isolation exercises which are more advanced). This will help you make the best progress in the shortest time.

- [Phrak's Greyskull Linear Progression](https://hashimashi.com/phraks-greyskull/) is amazing. Great for learning the basic lifts as well as not being time intensive. You start seeing results within 3 weeks, but should run a 12 week program until you see serious plateaus in your maximum weight lifts. Then move to a more involved exercise, either 4 day split or Greyskull with Plug-Ins. You can also do the less time efficient and original Greyskull LP if you'd like, or Starting Strength by the great Mark Rippetoe. Just be sure to avoid StrongLifts since it has poor programming that can lead you to noob gains but kill long-term progress.

- Niklas Lampi from Iron Built Fitness has a nice, detailed [guide](https://www.ironbuiltfitness.com/skinny-fat-to-ripped) on getting ripped, from workouts to nutrition. Uses a 3-day split program of MWF. The exercises are pretty similar to the Greyskull LP but are divided into upper and lower body rather than each day having a PPL component. This information is universal and you will see it in multiple places.

- Alan Thrall has a great [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLOLGZl3-QTaJfLmAKgoAw) for learning about weight lifting. His focus is generally on strongman competitions so this channel will primarily help increase strength, but the overall effects are cannot be ignored. I generally like his no-nonsense approach and strong opinions since it takes out a lot of the guesswork. If I ever move to Sacramento, I'm going to sign up at the Untamed Strength gym. TRAIN UNTAMED!!

- [BUFF Dudes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKf0UqBiCQI4Ol0To9V0pKQ) have a great channel with lots of great (and hilarious) videos that teach you the various exercises in a fun, detailed way. Big contrast to Alan Thrall's style. By the way, BUFF stands for Better Understanding of Food & Fitness, so don't bash on Hudson and Brandon for the name of their channel. Plus, their incredible physiques helps keep one motivated.

- Jeff Cavaliere runs [Athlean-X](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24) which is more focused on athlete training. Think conditioning, endurance, explosiveness alongwith strength. Great channel to learn stuff beyond basic strength training and add some challenging new exercises.

- More advanced lifters can move onto the [nSuns 5/3/1](https://physiqz.com/powerlifting-programs/nsuns-531-cap3/) training program. It combines the strength training aspect of the original 5/3/1 by Jim Wendler (recommended reading) with the high volume training of the Sheiko program, and comes in 4, 5, and 6 day variants. Note that each session can take a while to finish so be ready to put in the time.

- Found this crazy workout routine for a beach body in 6 weeks called [Built for the Beach](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/the-6-week-built-for-the-beach-program/). It's pretty intense so I don't recommend it for beginners.


## Cardiovascular Training

Workouts to build cardiovascular strength. These are mainly focused on running since that is the easiest and cheapest way to get crazy good endurance (other than swimming). All you need is a good pair of running shoes (look for $100 shoes on discount) and good weather outside.

- My go-to apps for recording runs are [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) and [Sportractive](http://sportractive.com/). I personally prefer Sportractive due to its direction integration with [Smashrun](https://smashrun.com/) which is a crazy awesome website for tracking your runs.

- Detailed [read](https://runnersconnect.net/5k-workouts/) on understanding elite runner training plans.

- Bunch of well-defined [training programs](https://hansons-running.com/pages/training-plans) for (Half-)Marathons if you want to challenge yourself for distance.


## Cross-Training

Here we focus on Plyometrics and Bodyweight exercises to boost explosiveness and endurance.

- Great [bodyweight plyometrics workout](https://greatist.com/fitness/explosive-bodyweight-exercises) for building explosiveness with divisions between Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

- More [plyometrics](https://www.runnersworld.co.za/training/7-explosive-moves-to-get-faster-stronger/), but aimed at runners so you can get faster. Needs a medicine ball but some great exercises with body-weight.

- Mostly [bodyweight](https://www.daystofitness.com/4-week-fat-burner-hiit-workout/) but needs a skipping rope and weights. Good for HIIT.


## Sample Training Plan

This is [Hrithik Roshan's training plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20190226045948/https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/hrithik-roshan-rediscovers-athleticism-with-kris-gethin.html) which got him his incredible, lean physique (despite recovering from injury). The plan was developed by Kris Gethin. Note that this plan is very specific so YMMV.
