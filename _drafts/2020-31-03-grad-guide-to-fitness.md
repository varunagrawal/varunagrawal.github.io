## Motivation

As grad students, we have multiple challenges in our daily lives other than our health. However, to be productive, we need to be healthy so our brains can function well and we have the energy to be focused on our work so we can graduate within a reasonable time frame. Add to that, a healthy body helps with your mood and you'll be more positive depsite all the crazy negativity surrounding your work environment. We don't want to risk dying young like the great Ramanujan.

This document is a means of providing a simple and straightforward guide to getting started on your fitness journey and achieving whatever goals you set for yourself, demystifying a lot of the jargon and confusing lingo that is encountered in the process, without the added expense usually involved. Being healthy can be expensive but it doesn't have to be, so the goal is to give you the best results while spending as little as possible (hopefully < $100 over the course of 5 years).

## Consistency

Every guide to fitness you will ever read on the internet will always mention **being consistent** as the biggest driver of results. If you're consistent, you will see results; if you're not, you won't. But what does being consistent mean? As a grad student with intermittent high stress periods (such as a paper deadline), how can you ensure you are consistent? Can you move workouts around and still achieve the desired effect? If you skip a workout, does that mean your entire endeavour was a failure?

Here's my definition of being consistent: **don't half-ass it!**

If you think about it, consistency and half-assing are essentially antonyms. If you follow through with a program, you are not half-assing it, so even if you shuffled the workout days a little, you still finished it and that counts for something. You were consistent with the program!

Similarly, when you begin your workout, don't finish one set and then spend the next 20 minutes admiring yourself in the mirror or being that person who posts the clichÃ©d motivational phrases with selfies on social media. Go all in, commit to that session, don't leave with regrets that you could have done one more repetition on that last set or ran for another mile. As a grad student, we have limited time since we could be working on other things, so go in finish the workout as within a set time and move on with the rest of your day. **Don't half-ass it!**

## Resistance Training

Resistance or Strength training involves using weights to build strength, shock your CNS into increasing your metabolism, and activate your muscles into growing bigger and more defined to get rid of the skinny-fat look. Skinny-fat is a state where you look skinny when wearing clothes, but when you take them off, you look squishy or weak or have fat deposits in all the wrong places - not the most appealing aesthetic.

Resistance training is generally easily accessible since most schools have on-campus gyms or recreation centers where they provide the necessary weights and equipment needed to perform all sorts of workouts. These facilities are provided as a part of your tuition so I highly recommended utilizing them since you have effectively paid for them.

Resistance training in the gym usually gets a bad rep due to the idea of *bro culture* that is prevalent, that gym goers are not intelligent human beings. In my personal experience, consistent resistance training has had the greatest effect on my overall fitness, not just in aesthetics but feeling good and strong throughut the day without the tiredness that comes from cardio training. Don't knock it till you give it a try.

Here, I try to avoid broscience (training misconceptions spread by the less informed) and focus on proven techniques involving compound exercises that hit multiple muscle groups (in contrast to isolation exercises which are more advanced). This will help you make the best progress in the shortest time. Below I list some tried and true workouts that I have personally used and seen great results with:

- [Phrak's Greyskull Linear Progression](https://hashimashi.com/phraks-greyskull/) is amazing. Great for learning the basic lifts as well as not being time intensive. You start seeing results within 3 weeks, but should run a 12 week program until you see serious plateaus in your maximum weight lifts. Then move to a more involved exercise, either 4 day split or Greyskull with Plug-Ins. You can also do the less time efficient and original Greyskull LP if you'd like, or Starting Strength by the great Mark Rippetoe. Just be sure to avoid StrongLifts since it has poor programming that can lead you to noob gains but kill long-term progress.

- Niklas Lampi from Iron Built Fitness has a nice, detailed [guide](https://www.ironbuiltfitness.com/skinny-fat-to-ripped) on getting ripped, from workouts to nutrition. Uses a 3-day split program of MWF. The exercises are pretty similar to the Greyskull LP but are divided into upper and lower body rather than each day having a PPL component. This information is universal and you will see it in multiple places.

- Alan Thrall has a great [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLOLGZl3-QTaJfLmAKgoAw) for learning about weight lifting. His focus is generally on strongman competitions so this channel will primarily help increase strength, but the overall effects are cannot be ignored. I generally like his no-nonsense approach and strong opinions since it takes out a lot of the guesswork. If I ever move to Sacramento, I'm going to sign up at the Untamed Strength gym. TRAIN UNTAMED!!

- [BUFF Dudes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKf0UqBiCQI4Ol0To9V0pKQ) have a great channel with lots of great (and hilarious) videos that teach you the various exercises in a fun, detailed way. Big contrast to Alan Thrall's style. By the way, BUFF stands for Better Understanding of Food & Fitness, so don't bash on Hudson and Brandon for the name of their channel. Plus, their incredible physiques helps keep one motivated.

- Jeff Cavaliere runs [Athlean-X](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24) which is more focused on athlete training. Think conditioning, endurance, explosiveness alongwith strength. Great channel to learn stuff beyond basic strength training and add some challenging new exercises.

- More advanced lifters can move onto the [nSuns 5/3/1](https://physiqz.com/powerlifting-programs/nsuns-531-cap3/) training program. It combines the strength training aspect of the original 5/3/1 by Jim Wendler (recommended reading) with the high volume training of the Sheiko program, and comes in 4, 5, and 6 day variants. Note that each session can take a while to finish so be ready to put in the time.

- Found this crazy workout routine for a beach body in 6 weeks called [Built for the Beach](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/the-6-week-built-for-the-beach-program/). It's pretty intense so I don't recommend it for beginners.


## Cardiovascular Training

Workouts to build cardiovascular strength. 

### Running 

Running is the easiest and cheapest way to get crazy good endurance (other than swimming). All you need is a good pair of running shoes (look for $100 shoes on discount) and good weather outside.

- My go-to apps for recording runs are [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) and [Sportractive](http://sportractive.com/). I personally prefer Sportractive due to its direct integration with [Smashrun](https://smashrun.com/) which is a crazy awesome website for tracking your runs.

- Detailed [read](https://runnersconnect.net/5k-workouts/) on understanding elite runner training plans. You can use this as a training template if you enjoy running and want to start partaking in local 5Ks and Half Marathons.

- Bunch of well-defined [training programs](https://hansons-running.com/pages/training-plans) for (Half-)Marathons if you want to challenge yourself for distance while putting in a personal record.

### Jump Rope

Jumping rope is another great way to boost your cardiovascular health. Not only do you get a quality workout in, but you can go really advanced with all sorts of skipping patterns and variations. All you need is a skipping rope that costs <$10 on Amazon (you can pay for it via a research study gift card).

The [Jump Rope Dudes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYew1VwdbpHnSFG-CQ1A-A) run an excellent Youtube channel where they give you details on various patterns, workouts, and other tips and tricks so you get the most fun and intensity out of jumping rope. 

If you really want to challenge yourself, you can try investing in a weighted rope. These are slightly more expensive, but they add that extra level if you need it.

## Cross-Training

Here we focus on Plyometrics and Bodyweight exercises to boost explosiveness and endurance. This is great for conditioning your body to react quickly and helps with your metabolism while complementing other training programs.

- Great [bodyweight plyometrics workout](https://greatist.com/fitness/explosive-bodyweight-exercises) for building explosiveness with divisions between Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

- More [plyometrics](https://www.runnersworld.co.za/training/7-explosive-moves-to-get-faster-stronger/), but aimed at runners so you can get faster. Needs a medicine ball but some great exercises with body-weight.

- Mostly [bodyweight](https://www.daystofitness.com/4-week-fat-burner-hiit-workout/) but needs a skipping rope and weights. Good for HIIT.


## A Sample Training Plan

This is [Hrithik Roshan's training plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20190226045948/https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/hrithik-roshan-rediscovers-athleticism-with-kris-gethin.html) which got him his incredible, lean physique (despite recovering from injury). The plan was developed by Kris Gethin. Note that this plan is very specific to him so YMMV. See the link for more specific details of warm-up sets and working sets as well as images illustrating the workout.

Word of advice though: this is an advanced workout routine, and if you don't already have 12 weeks of beginner-to-intermediate level training experience, I do not recommend this for you. Start with an easy workout, going 3 days a week, and slowly challenging yourself by increasing the frequency to 4 or maybe even 5 days a week. At that point, this workout will give you that little extra you need to achieve your goals. You can also customize it to include other workouts, as long as you ensure you are hitting the same muscle groups.
