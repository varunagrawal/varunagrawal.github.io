        <!--<h2>About Me</h2>-->

        <div style="text-align:justify;">
            <p class="">
                I am a Robotics Padawan (a.k.a. PhD student) under Jedi master <a href="https://dellaert.github.io/" target="_blank">Frank Dellaert</a> at the <a href="https://www.ic.gatech.edu/">School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech</a>. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www.robotics.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines</a> and the <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Machine Learning Center</a>.

                My areas of research are Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.
            </p>

            <p class="">
                I received my Masters degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech where my thesis was on Visual Attribute Labeling. I was advised by <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/" target="_blank">Dr. James Hays</a> and collaborated with the incredible <a href="https://genp.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Genevieve Patterson</a>. Other projects of mine included enabling robots to track industrial parts in real time, and industrial robot drivers to make working with them easier.
                <br/>
                I was the recipient of the Marshall D. Williamson Fellowship for outstanding 2nd year MSCS student at Georgia Tech.

                In a previous life, I spent a stint at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/">Microsoft Corp's Hyderabad office</a>, where I contributed to the Bing search engine and Enterprise Volume Licensing pipeline. I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://svnit.ac.in">NIT Surat</a> where I was president of the ACM Chapter and Chief Editor of the college newsletter.

            <p class="">
                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, basketball, music, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="As defined by Eric S. Raymond">hacking</a>. Do check out my blog for my latest musings, where I try to elucidate some non-trivial science and tech into regular tea-time reading.
