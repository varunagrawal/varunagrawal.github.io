        <!--<h2>About Me</h2>-->

        <div style="text-align:justify;">
            <p class="">
                I am a Robotics Padawan (a.k.a. PhD candidate) under Jedi master <a href="https://dellaert.github.io/"
                    target="_blank">Frank Dellaert</a> at the <a href="https://www.ic.gatech.edu/"
                    target="_blank">School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech</a>. I am affiliated with the <a
                    href="https://research.gatech.edu/robotics" target="_blank">Institute for Robotics and Intelligent
                    Machines</a> and the <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Machine Learning Center</a>.

                My areas of research are Robotics and Intelligent Autonomy. While my primary focus is on state
                estimation, I work on multiple areas of robotics such as Human Robot Interaction, Optimal and Learning
                based Control, and Perception. Along with being a researcher, I take great pride in developing useable
                and reliable systems that put our work into practice.

            <p class="">
                I received my Masters degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech where my thesis was on Visual
                Attribute Labeling. I was advised by <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/" target="_blank">Dr.
                    James Hays</a> and collaborated with the incredible <a href="https://genp.github.io/"
                    target="_blank">Dr. Genevieve Patterson</a>. Other projects of mine included enabling robots to
                track industrial parts in real time, industrial robot drivers to make working with them easier, and
                building online tools to enable and help student teaming.
                <br/>
                For my efforts, I received the 2017 Marshall D. Williamson Fellowship for outstanding 2nd year MSCS student
                at Georgia Tech.
                <br />
                I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://svnit.ac.in"
                    target="_blank">NIT Surat</a> where I was president of the ACM Chapter, growing the club to over 200
                student members, and co-Chief Editor of the college newsletter <a href="https://www.renesasvnit.com/"
                    target="_blank">Renesa</a> with the uber talented pair of <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kailashamr/" target="_blank">Kailasham Ramalingam</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/swethanjasty/" target="_blank">Swethan Jasty</a>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="">
                Professionally, I have spent time at <a href="https://www.skydio.com/" target="_blank">Skydio</a>, and
                the <a href="https://robots.ihmc.us/" target="_blank">IHMC Robotics lab</a>, as well as a previous stint
                at
                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/" target="_blank">Microsoft Corp's Hyderabad
                    office</a>, where I
                contributed to the Bing search engine and Enterprise Volume Licensing pipeline.

            <p class="">
                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, basketball, music, and <a

                    data-placement="top" title="As defined by Eric S. Raymond">hacking</a>. Do check out my blog for my
                latest musings, where I try to elucidate some non-trivial science and tech into regular tea-time
                reading.
