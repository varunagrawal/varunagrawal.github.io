        <div style="text-align:justify;">
            <p class="">
                I am a Padawan (a.k.a. PhD student) in Computer Science under Jedi master <a href="https://dellaert.github.io/" target="_blank">Frank Dellaert</a> at the <a href="https://www.ic.gatech.edu/">School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech</a>. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www.robotics.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines</a> and the <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Machine Learning Center</a>.

                My areas of research are Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning.

            <p class="">
                Before starting my PhD, I was a Masters student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech where I worked on multiple projects which included helping computers understand visual attributes of objects in images, enabling robots to track industrial parts in real time, and writing industrial robot drivers to make working with them easier. I was the recipient of the Marshall D. Williamson Fellowship.

                In a previous life, I spent a stint at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/">Microsoft Corp's Hyderabad office</a>, where I contributed to the Bing search engine and Enterprise Volume Licensing pipeline. I completed my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://svnit.ac.in">NIT Surat</a> where I was president of the ACM Chapter and Chief Editor of the college newsletter.

            <p class="">
                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, basketball, music, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="As defined by Eric S. Raymond">hacking</a>. Do check out my blog for my latest musings, where I try to elucidate some non-trivial science and tech into regular tea-time reading.
