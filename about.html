            <p class="">
                I am a Padawan (a.k.a. PhD student) in Computer Science under Jedi masters <a href="http://prof.irfanessa.com/" target="_blank">Irfan Essa</a> and <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/" target="_blank">James Hays</a> at <a href="http://www.ic.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> (Go Jackets!).

                My areas of research are Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Robotics.

            <p class="">
                Before starting my PhD, I was a Masters student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech where I worked on multiple projects which included helping computers understand visual attributes of objects in images, enabling robots to track industrial parts in real time, and writing industrial robot drivers to make working with them easier. I was the recipient of the Marshall D. Williamson Fellowship.

                In a previous life, I spent a stint at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/">Microsoft India R&D Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad</a>, where I contributed to the Bing search engine and Enterprise Volume Licensing pipeline. I completed my undergrad (B.Tech) from NIT Surat where I was president of the ACM Chapter and Chief Editor of the college newsletter.

                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, basketball, music, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="As defined by Eric S. Raymond">hacking</a>. Do check out my blog for my latest musings, where I try to elucidate some non-trivial science and tech into regular tea-time reading.
