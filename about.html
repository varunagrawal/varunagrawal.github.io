            <p class="">
                I am a Padawan (a.k.a. PhD student) in Computer Science under Jedi masters <a href="http://prof.irfanessa.com/" target="_blank">Irfan Essa</a> and <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/" target="_blank">James Hays</a> in the <a href="http://www.ic.gatech.edu/">School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech</a> (Go Jackets!).
            </p>

            <p class="">
                My areas of research are Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Robotics.

                Before following the ways of the Force, I was a Masters student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech where I worked on multiple projects which included helping computers understand attributes of objects in images, and enabling robots to track industrial parts in real time. I also wrote some industrial robot drivers to make working with them easier.

                In a previous life, I spent a stint at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/">Microsoft India R&D Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad</a>, where I contributed to the Bing search engine and Enterprise Volume Licensing pipeline. I completed my undergrad (B.Tech) from NIT Surat where I was president of the ACM Chapter and Chief Editor of the college newsletter, Renesa.

                In my spare time, enjoy reading, basketball, music, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="As defined by Eric S. Raymond">hacking</a>. Do check out my blog for my latest musings, where I try to elucidate some pretty crazy science into regular tea-time reading.
