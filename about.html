                Before following the ways of the Force, I was a force-sensitive Masters student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech where I worked on helping computers understand attributes of objects in images. During this time, I also did quite a bit of robotics research with <a href="http://robotics.gatech.edu/team/faculty/sweet" target="_blank">Dr. Larry Sweet</a> at the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines.

                I spent a stint at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/">Microsoft India R&D Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad</a>, where I contributed to the Bing search engine and Enterprise Volume Licensing pipeline. During this time and my undergrad at NIT Surat, I obtained a background in Systems and Security.
