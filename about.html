                My interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Operating Systems and Computer Security. These interests have led to an Exam Rank To College ML Classifier (which is due for a patent), a Facebook Birthday-wish replying bot, a 8085 microprocessor assembler,
                1st and 3rd place successively in Microsoft's All India Capture The Flag event and a due-to-be-published/patented algorithm to index music based on concepts in their lyrics.

                as the President of the <a target="_blank" href="http://nitsurat.acm.org/">ACM Student Chapter</a> (alongside my awesome team), as well as spent a year as Chief Editor of the college newsletter. I have also appeared on radio for an interview
